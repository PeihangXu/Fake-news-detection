# Fake-news-detection

This project is using the data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset 

The job is to classify fake/true news from the text.

Here I used NLP to process the text and used GRU layer for neural nets.

The test accuracy can get up to ~98%.
